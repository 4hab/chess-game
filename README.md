### Two players chess game
I made this game for the second time
the first time I was a little bit confused about OOP and wasn't capable to create such a project, Anyway
when I uploaded the game and asked for feedbacks many people advised me to learn about (OOP and Design patterns) 
and now after 3 years I thought it's the time to see how much my code got better so I decieded to develop it again from scratch
with a decent design
Here is my design

### UML diagram

these 2 features aren't ready yet but they are in my todo list anyway and will be added very soon

waiting for your contributions and your Feedback!
